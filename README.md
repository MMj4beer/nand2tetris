### In this project i will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. Weâ€™ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.

#### Boolean Logic
#### Boolean Arithmetic
#### Sequential Logic
#### Machine Language
#### Computer Architecture
#### Assembler
#### VM I: Stack Arithmetic
#### VM II: Program Control
#### High-Level Language
#### Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
#### Compiler II: Code Generation
#### Operating System
